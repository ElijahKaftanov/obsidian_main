Not my post but thought I'd share
The Sardaukar language, like the Sardaukar themselves, relies on being efficient and survives on as little as possible. 

When I first watched this, I didn’t realize it was English, but it is.  Sort of.  Being the most brutally efficient army going, they found a way to speak it as efficiently as possible by trimming as much as they could while still being able to convey meaning. 

Here’s the recipe:
-Take English
-Get rid of 75% of the sounds and syllables. 
-Now slam what’s left together.  
-simplify vowel sounds down to “eh”, “ah”, “ee” or oo”. 
-Speed it up by giving it an almost superhuman ability of being able to produce literally two sounds at once, sounds over sounds. 

“No! We are the Sardaukar!” 
“N.                 th   Sardaukar!”
(compress and speed up)
“nah! (Tha/Sa)daukar! 

“Those who stand against us fall!”
 “     se-who st-         gai-st u- falla “
(compress and speed up)
“suh-oost-ageesta-fallah”


“It is done”
“It  s-d-
“Et’sa-duh”

The only word they don’t shorten is “Sardaukar”.   
Which is badass. They let that stay long.  
Maybe it’s already a shortened version of something originally bigger. 

The people who worked on this movie are next level.
